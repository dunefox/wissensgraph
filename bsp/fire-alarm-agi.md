# There’s No Fire Alarm for Artificial General Intelligence
Quelle: https://intelligence.org/2017/10/13/fire-alarm/

Article about the future of artificial intelligence and how it is almost impossible to estimate the time of arrival of groundbreaking technology until it's here

The author identifies five points:
* Work on the subject even if no time of arrival is forseeable
				    * "As Stuart Russell observed, if you get radio signals from space and spot a spaceship there with your telescopes and you know the aliens are landing in thirty years, you still start thinking about that today."
* Even for experts it is almost impossible to estimate correctly
    * "In 1901, two years before helping build the first heavier-than-air flyer, Wilbur Wright told his brother that powered flight was [fifty years away](https://books.google.com/books?id=ldxfLyNIk9wC&pg=PA91&dq="i+said+to+my+brother+orville"&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwioiseChcnWAhWL-VQKHab6AqMQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=%22i%20said%20to%20my%20brother%20orville%22&f=false)."
* Progress is driven by peak knowledge, not average knowledge
    * "If Fermi and the Wrights couldn’t see it coming three years out, imagine how hard it must be for anyone else to see it."
* The necessary tools might not have been developed, thus what seems impossible now might seem possible in 5 years
* The progress needed is unclear (?)
